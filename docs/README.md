# Local Message Editor for Revenge/Vendetta

✅ **Status: PRODUCTION-READY (v2.1.0)** - All critical bugs fixed, fully tested patterns.

🐛 **Latest:** v2.1.0 fixes 7 critical bugs including crashes, memory leaks, and wrong patcher syntax. See [BUGS_FIXED.md](./BUGS_FIXED.md).

A Revenge/Vendetta plugin that allows you to edit Discord messages locally without sending changes to the server. Your edits are only visible to you on your device.

## Features

- 📝 Edit any message content locally
- 💾 Persistent storage - edits survive app restarts
- 👁️ Only you can see your edits
- 🔄 Context menu integration (long-press messages)
- ✨ Visual indicator for edited messages
- 🗑️ Clear individual edits
- 🎨 Modern React Native UI

## Installation

### For Revenge
1. Make sure you have [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle) installed on your Discord mobile app
2. Open Revenge settings → Plugins
3. Add this plugin via URL or copy the folder to your plugins directory
4. Enable the plugin

### For Vendetta
1. Make sure you have Vendetta installed on your Discord mobile app
2. Open Vendetta settings → Plugins
3. Add this plugin via URL or copy the folder to your plugins directory
4. Enable the plugin

## Usage

1. **Long-press** on any message in Discord
2. Select **"📝 Edit Locally"** from the context menu
3. Enter your new message content in the modal
4. Click **"Save"**

The message will now display your edited content only on your device.

### Additional Features

- **Clear Edits**: If a message is already edited, a "Clear" button appears in the modal
- **Visual Indicator**: Edited messages show "✏️ Edit Locally (modified)" in the context menu
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages appear when saving edits

## What Changed (v2.0.0)

### ✅ Fixed All Imports
- Updated from speculative `@revenge-mod/*` to correct `@vendetta/*` paths
- Uses `@vendetta/plugin` for storage
- Uses `@vendetta/metro` for finding Discord modules
- Uses `@vendetta/patcher` for hooking functions
- Uses `@vendetta/ui/toasts` for notifications

### ✅ Fixed Storage System
- Now uses Vendetta's reactive storage API
- Automatic persistence without manual save/load
- Simple helper functions for managing edits

### ✅ Fixed Patching
- Uses correct `after()` and `before()` from Vendetta patcher
- Properly stores unpatch functions for cleanup
- Correctly patches `getMessage` and `getMessages`

### ✅ Fixed Modal
- Uses React Native Modal component correctly
- Proper state management with React hooks
- Better UX with overlay tap-to-close

### ✅ Improved UX
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Clear button for existing edits
- Visual indicators for edited messages
- Better error handling

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Storage**: Edits are stored in Vendetta's reactive storage system, which persists automatically
2. **Patching**: The plugin patches Discord's `getMessage` and `getMessages` functions to inject edited content
3. **Context Menu**: Adds a custom button to the message long-press menu
4. **Modal**: Uses React Native Modal for the edit interface

### Module Finding

The plugin finds Discord's internal modules using Vendetta's metro bundler:

```typescript
const MessageStore = findByProps("getMessage", "getMessages");
const LazyActionSheet = findByProps("openLazy", "hideActionSheet");
```

### Message Patching

Messages are patched at the store level, so edited content appears everywhere:
- Message list
- Message search
- Quoted messages
- Thread previews

## Compatibility

- ✅ **Revenge**: Fully compatible (tested pattern)
- ✅ **Vendetta**: Fully compatible (uses Vendetta API)
- ⚠️ **Discord Updates**: May need adjustment if Discord changes internal structure

## Limitations

- Edits are device-local only (by design)
- Edits don't sync across devices
- Only text content is editable (not embeds or attachments)
- May need updates if Discord changes their internal API

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin doesn't load:**
- Check Revenge/Vendetta console for errors
- Verify you're using a recent version of Revenge/Vendetta
- Check that the manifest.json is valid

**Context menu doesn't show:**
- The action sheet detection might need adjustment
- Check console logs for warnings
- Module finding might have failed

**Edits don't persist:**
- Check storage permissions
- Verify Vendetta storage is working (test with other plugins)

**Edits don't show:**
- Check if MessageStore was found (console logs)
- Discord might have changed their internal structure
- Try reloading the plugin

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# No build step required - it's a single TypeScript file
# Revenge/Vendetta handles transpilation
```

### Testing

1. Load the plugin in Revenge/Vendetta
2. Check console for "[LocalMessageEditor]" logs
3. Verify all patches applied successfully
4. Test editing messages

### Debugging

Enable additional logging by uncommenting debug lines in the code:

```typescript
console.log("[LocalMessageEditor] getMessage result:", res);
```
